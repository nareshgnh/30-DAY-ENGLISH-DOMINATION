# CORE RULES

## RULE 1: 4-7-8 BREATHING (Before & During Interviews)

**When:** Before interviews, when nervous during questions, when you need to pause

**How:** Inhale (4 counts) → Hold (7 counts) → Exhale (8 counts)

**Why:** Activates parasympathetic nervous system, reduces anxiety physiologically

**Examples in interviews:**
- Interviewer asks tough question → Take visible breath → Answer calmly
- You feel nervous → Subtle 4-7-8 breath → Continue confidently
- Before interview starts → 3 rounds of 4-7-8 → Enter calm and ready

---

## RULE 2: SPEAK SLOWER WHEN NERVOUS

**Pattern:** Nervousness = faster speech = mistakes. Solution: Deliberately slow down.

**How:** Pause after every sentence. Speak at 80% of normal speed when nervous.

**Examples:**
❌ Nervous: "SoIworkonautomationtestingandIhave6yearsexperienceandI'mreallygoodatPlaywright..."
✅ Calm: "I work on automation testing. [PAUSE] I have 6 years of experience. [PAUSE] My specialty is Playwright."

**Practice:** Record yourself nervous vs calm. Hear the difference.

## RULE 3: ELIMINATE ALL FILLER WORDS

**Filler words:** um, uh, like, you know, basically, actually (when overused)

**Solution:** PAUSE instead of filling silence

**Training:**
- Every time you want to say "um" → Pause for 2 seconds
- Think of silence as power, not awkwardness
- Strategic pauses make you sound thoughtful, not hesitant

**Examples:**
❌ "Um, I think, uh, automation is, like, really important, you know?"
✅ "Automation is important. [PAUSE] Let me explain why. [PAUSE] First..."

---

## RULE 4: THE PAUSE-THINK-SPEAK PATTERN

**When asked tough question:**
1. PAUSE (2 seconds) - Don't speak immediately
2. THINK (organize your answer mentally)
3. SPEAK (deliver structured response)

**Why:** Pausing shows confidence. Immediate rambling shows nervousness.

**Examples:**
Q: "What's your biggest weakness?"
❌ "Um, well, I guess, maybe, I don't know, probably..."
✅ [2 second pause] "That's a great question. [PAUSE] My biggest area for growth is [X]. Here's how I'm addressing it..."

## RULE 5: PRESSURE MANTRAS

**Mental scripts for high-pressure moments:**

Before interview:
- "I've prepared for 25 days. I am ready."
- "Pressure is where I shine."
- "They're lucky to interview someone with my skills."

During tough questions:
- "I can handle this."
- "Pause, think, deliver."
- "This is just a conversation."

When nervous:
- "Breathe. Slow down. You've got this."
- "Silence is power."
- "One question at a time."
