Nervous = fast speech = mistakes. Solution: Deliberately slow to 80% speed.

**Rule 3: PAUSE INSTEAD OF "UM"**
❌ "Um, I think, uh..."
✅ [2-second pause] "Here's what I think..."

**Rule 4: PAUSE-THINK-SPEAK**
Don't answer immediately. Pause 2 seconds. Think. Then speak.

**Rule 5: SILENCE IS POWER**
Awkward silence? Stay calm. Don't ramble. Silence shows confidence.
