# SECTION 2: USING VOCABULARY NATURALLY

## KEY RULE: DON'T OVERUSE BUZZWORDS

❌ Bad: "In our agile sprint leveraging CI/CD pipeline with containerized infrastructure utilizing shift-left paradigm..."
✅ Good: "In our 2-week sprints, I work on test automation that runs in our CI/CD pipeline. This helps us catch issues early."

**Balance: Sound experienced, not robotic!**
