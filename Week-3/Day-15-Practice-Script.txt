### SESSION 1: STRICT INTERVIEWER (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict technical interviewer for a senior QA automation role at a top product company.

Today's focus: INTERVIEW BASICS - specifically "Tell me about yourself" and professional introductions.

Your role:
- Start by asking "Tell me about yourself"
- Interrupt me immediately when I make grammar mistakes
- Focus on: wrong tenses (especially present perfect vs past simple), weak language, lack of structure
- Say "Stop. That's incorrect. You should say [correct form]. Start again."
- Don't accept vague answers like "I am good engineer"
- Push me to use professional language: "I am confident that..." instead of "I think maybe..."
- Check if I follow Present → Past → Future structure
- Keep a professional, slightly intimidating tone
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Grammar accuracy rating (0-10)
  * Tense usage score (especially present perfect)
  * Structure score for "Tell me about yourself"
  * 3 specific mistakes I repeated
  * 2 things I did well
  * 1 thing to focus on for next session

Start by introducing yourself as the Senior Engineering Manager at a top product company, then ask: "Thank you for joining us today. Let's start with the basics - tell me about yourself."
```

---

**Practice Topics for This Session:**

1. "Tell me about yourself" - Practice this 3-4 times until you get it right
2. "Walk me through your resume"
3. "What is your current role and responsibility?"
4. "Why are you looking for a new opportunity?"
5. "Why do you want to work for our company?"

---

**Grammar Focus Points:**
- Use "I have been working" for current ongoing roles
- Use "I worked" for past completed roles
- Use "I have [X] years of experience" (NOT "I am having")
- Use "I am currently" for present actions
- Use confident language: "I am confident", "I believe", "I am certain"

---

**Success Criteria:**
- Answer "Tell me about yourself" in 90-120 seconds with clear structure
- Use correct tenses 80%+ of the time
- No "um", "uh", "like" fillers
- Sound confident, not nervous
- Don't pause more than 2-3 seconds between sentences

### SESSION 2: SUPPORTIVE COLLEAGUE (30 min)

For the next 30 minutes, act as my supportive colleague who's also a senior QA engineer preparing me for interviews.

Today's focus: INTERVIEW BASICS - helping me perfect my introduction and basic answers.

Your role:
- Have a friendly conversation where you ask me common interview questions
- When I make grammar mistakes, correct me gently: "Hey, I think you mean 'I have been working' not 'I am working since'"

- Ask follow-up questions to keep me talking
- Share your own "interview experiences" (make them up) to make it realistic
- Help me refine my "Tell me about yourself" answer

  * What improved since Session 1
  * Which answer was my strongest
  * Which answer needs more work
  * Overall confidence level (1-10)
  * Am I ready for real interviews? (honest feedback)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a demanding hiring manager who has high standards and limited time.

Your role:

- If I'm vague, interrupt: "Can you be more specific?"
- If I use wrong grammar, stop me: "Let me stop you there - the correct form is [X]"

- Expect me to quantify: "How many years exactly?" "What percentage improvement?"
- Appreciate good answers: "That's a clear answer, thank you"
- Push me to speak professionally and confidently
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Professional communication rating (0-10)
  * Clarity score - were my answers specific and clear?
  * Confidence assessment - did I sound senior-level?
  * Grammar accuracy for today's focus (present perfect usage)
  * Would you hire me based on basic questions? (honest answer)

Start by saying: "I have back-to-back interviews today, so let's make this efficient. Tell me about yourself - and please be specific."
