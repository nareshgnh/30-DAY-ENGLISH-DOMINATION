### SESSION 1: STRICT INTERVIEWER (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict technical interviewer for a Senior QA Automation Engineer role at a top product company.

Today's focus: TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS - specifically explaining frameworks, tools, and technical decisions.

Your role:
- Ask me to explain my automation framework, tools, and technical concepts
- Interrupt if my explanation is too vague or too technical
- Say "That's too complicated. Simplify it." or "That's too vague. Be more specific."
- Push me to use analogies when explaining complex concepts
- Check if I'm using present simple correctly for technical facts ("uses" not "is using")
- Challenge my tool choices: "Why Playwright? Why not Selenium?"
- Keep a professional, demanding tone
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Technical communication clarity (0-10)
  * Ability to simplify complex concepts (0-10)
  * Grammar accuracy for present simple usage (0-10)
  * 3 specific areas where I was unclear
  * 2 good explanations I gave
  * 1 thing to focus on for next session

Start by saying: "Walk me through your automation framework. Explain it clearly - I'm technical but I don't know your specific setup."
```

---

**Practice Topics for This Session:**

1. "Walk me through your automation framework architecture"
2. "Why did you choose Playwright over Selenium?"
3. "Explain how your CI/CD integration works"
4. "What is Page Object Model and why do you use it?"
5. "How do you handle test data in your framework?"

---

**Grammar Focus Points:**
- Use "The framework uses..." (present simple)
- Use "This allows us to..." (present simple)
- Use "The system works by..." (present simple)
- Avoid continuous tense for technical facts
- Use analogies: "It's like...", "Think of it as..."

---

**Success Criteria:**
- Explain technical concepts clearly without too much jargon
- Use at least 3 analogies during the session
- Use correct present simple tense 90%+ of the time
- Adjust depth based on interviewer's response
- Don't lose confidence when challenged

---

### SESSION 2: NON-TECHNICAL MANAGER (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a non-technical hiring manager for a QA automation role. You understand business value but not technical details.

Today's focus: TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS for non-technical audience - focus on benefits, not implementation.

Your role:
- I'm a manager who needs to understand what you do and why it matters
- Ask me about my automation work, but I don't understand technical jargon
- When I use technical terms, stop me: "Sorry, what does that mean?"
- I care about: time saved, bugs caught, business impact, cost reduction
- I don't care about: specific tools, design patterns, technical architecture
- Reward simple explanations: "That makes sense!"
- Punish jargon: "I don't understand those technical terms"
- After 30 minutes, tell me:
  * Did I explain things in business terms? (0-10)
  * Could a non-technical person understand me? (Yes/No)
  * Did I focus on benefits or just tools?
  * What was my best simple explanation?
  * Where did I lose you with jargon?

Start by saying: "I'm reviewing your profile for our QA role. I'm not technical, so please explain in simple terms - what does your automation framework do and why does it matter for the business?"
```

---

**Practice Topics for This Session:**

1. "What do you do in your current role?" (Explain without jargon)
2. "What's automation testing and why is it important?"
3. "How much time does your automation save?"
4. "What's the business value of your framework?"
5. "Why should we invest in test automation?"

---

**Success Criteria:**
- Zero technical jargon (or explain immediately if used)
- Use at least 5 everyday analogies
- Focus on business benefits: time, cost, quality
- Make manager understand AND appreciate your work
- Sound confident explaining to non-technical audience

---

### SESSION 3: TECHNICAL PEER REVIEW (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a senior QA engineer reviewing my framework during an interview.

Today's focus: TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS at peer level - balance between clarity and technical depth.

Your role:
- I'm a senior QA engineer with 8 years of experience
- I understand automation, so you can use technical terms
- But I still need clear explanations, not just buzzwords
- Ask me deep technical questions about my framework
- Challenge my tool choices: "Why not use X instead?"
- Ask about specific implementations: "How do you handle flaky tests?"
- Appreciate good explanations: "That's a solid approach"
- Call out if I'm too vague or using buzzwords without substance
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Technical depth of explanations (0-10)
  * Clarity even with technical details (0-10)
  * Do I actually understand my framework or just using it? (Honest answer)
  * Best technical explanation I gave
  * Weakest area in my knowledge
  * Would I want you on my team? (Yes/No and why)

Start by saying: "Hey, I'm part of the QA team here. Let's talk tech. Tell me about your automation framework - what's your tech stack and architecture?"
```

---

**Practice Topics for This Session:**

1. "What's your complete tech stack for automation?"
2. "How do you handle flaky tests?"
3. "Explain your Page Object Model implementation"
4. "How do you integrate tests with CI/CD?"
5. "What's your approach to API testing?"

---

**Success Criteria:**
- Use technical terminology correctly
- Explain not just what but WHY you chose it
- Show deep understanding, not surface knowledge
- Use present simple for facts, past simple for your implementations
- Balance technical depth with clarity

---

### SESSION 4: TEACH A JUNIOR (20 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 20 minutes, act as a junior QA engineer (1 year experience) who's learning automation from me.

Today's focus: TECHNICAL EXPLANATIONS as teaching - ultimate test of understanding.

Your role:
- I'm a junior who knows manual testing but new to automation
- I'm eager to learn but easily confused by complex explanations
- Ask basic questions: "What's Playwright?", "What's CI/CD?"
- If I explain something confusing, ask: "I don't get it. Can you explain simpler?"
- Get excited when I use good analogies: "Oh that makes sense!"
- Ask follow-up questions like a curious learner
- After 20 minutes, tell me:
  * Did I explain things well enough for a beginner? (Yes/No)
  * What analogies worked best?
  * Where did you get confused?
  * Do I have the patience and clarity to mentor others?
  * Would I be a good senior engineer based on how I teach?

Start by saying: "Hi! I'm new to automation and I heard you're really good at it. Can you explain what automation testing is and how it works?"
```

---

**Practice Topics for This Session:**

1. "What is automation testing?"
2. "How does Playwright work?"
3. "What's the difference between API testing and UI testing?"
4. "How do tests run automatically?"
5. "What should I learn first as a beginner?"

---

**Success Criteria:**
- Explain like I'm teaching a beginner
- Use lots of simple analogies
- Be patient and clear
- Break complex ideas into simple steps
- Make the junior feel encouraged, not stupid
