I just completed a full mock interview. My weak areas were:
1. [Your weakness 1]
2. [Your weakness 2]
3. [Your weakness 3]

For the next 60 minutes, drill me ONLY on my weak areas.

If I struggled with STAR stories → Give me 10 behavioral questions
If I struggled with technical explanations → Make me explain concepts 10 different ways
If I struggled with pressure questions → Fire tough questions rapidly
If I struggled with grammar → Interrupt every mistake and make me repeat correctly

Be tough. Make me practice my weaknesses until they become strengths.

After 60 min, re-test those areas and tell me if I improved.
