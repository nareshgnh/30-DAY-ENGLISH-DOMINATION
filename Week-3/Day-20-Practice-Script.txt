### SESSION 1: TOUGH QUESTIONS RAPID FIRE (40 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt:**

```
Act as a tough interviewer asking pressure questions rapidly.

Ask me:
- Salary expectations
- Biggest weakness
- Why leaving current job
- Biggest failure
- Why should we hire you
- Gap in resume
- How you handle criticism
- Working with difficult people
- Overqualified concerns
- Current salary

Fire questions quickly. Evaluate:
- Do I stay calm or get flustered?
- Are answers honest but strategic?
- Grammar accuracy under pressure
- Do I turn negatives into positives?

After 40 min, rate my composure and answers (0-10).

Start: "Let's get to some direct questions. What are your salary expectations?"
```
