**CONFIDENCE BOOST STATEMENT:**

Day 18! Midweek of Week 3! You've conquered interview basics, technical explanations, and behavioral storytelling. Today is different - today you learn to be HUMAN in interviews.

Today you learn to sound natural, friendly, and professional in casual conversations. This is the subtle skill that opens doors. Let's master it!

**ENERGY STATEMENT:**

Day 18! SMALL TALK = BIG IMPACT! This isn't just casual chitchat - this is building relationships, showing you're easy to work with, proving cultural fit. Interviews aren't interrogations. They're conversations with coffee. Today you learn to START strong with small talk, END strong with small talk, and make the interviewer think "I'd enjoy working with this person every day." This skill alone can be the difference between "good candidate" and "HIRE THIS PERSON!" Let's dominate the human side of interviews!
