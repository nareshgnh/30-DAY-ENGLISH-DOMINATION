### SESSION 1: ASKING QUESTIONS TO HIRING MANAGER (30 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt:**

```
Act as a hiring manager for a QA automation role. After a brief interview, ask me "Do you have any questions for me?"

Evaluate my questions on:
- Relevance and intelligence
- Genuine curiosity vs scripted
- Clarity of question phrasing
- Whether questions help me evaluate the role
- Grammar and professionalism

After 30 min, rate my questions (0-10) and tell me which impressed you and which were weak.

Start by saying: "Those are all my questions. Now, do you have any questions for me?"
```

**Practice asking 10-12 questions covering role, team, growth, and culture.**

### SESSION 2: ASKING QUESTIONS TO TEAM MEMBER (30 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt:**

```
Act as a senior QA engineer (my potential peer). After chatting about the team, I'll ask you questions.

Respond naturally and evaluate:
- Are questions appropriate for a peer vs manager?
- Do I ask about real work challenges?
- Cultural fit questions

After 30 min, tell me: would you want me on your team based on my questions?

Start by saying: "Any questions for me about the team or day-to-day work?"
```

### SESSION 3: CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS DURING INTERVIEW (30 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt:**

```
Act as an interviewer giving me information about the role. Sometimes be vague or unclear.

I need to practice asking clarification questions politely:
- "Could you elaborate on..."
- "Can you give me an example of..."
- "What exactly do you mean by..."

Test if I ask for clarification or just nod and pretend to understand.

Rate my clarification question skills after 30 min.
```

### SESSION 4: FULL INTERVIEW WITH QUESTION ROUND (30 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt:**

```
Conduct a complete 30-minute interview:
- 15 min: You ask me questions
- 15 min: I ask you questions

Evaluate the entire flow and my question quality in context.

Give final rating: Are my questions senior-level quality?
```
