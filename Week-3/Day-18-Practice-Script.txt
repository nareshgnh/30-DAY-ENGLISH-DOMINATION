### SESSION 1: INTERVIEW SMALL TALK OPENER (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as an interviewer who values small talk and rapport building before diving into technical questions.

Today's focus: SMALL TALK at the START of interviews - building rapport in the first 2-3 minutes.

Your role:
- Greet me warmly as an interviewer would
- Respond naturally to my small talk attempts
- If I jump straight to business, gently redirect: "Before we start, how are you doing today?"
- Engage in 2-3 minutes of small talk (weather, weekend, commute, etc.) before each "interview"
- Rate my small talk naturalness: forced vs authentic
- Notice if I'm asking good follow-up questions or just mechanical questions
- After we do small talk, say "Great, let's get started with the interview" then ask one technical question to transition
- Do this cycle 5-6 times with different scenarios (Monday morning, Friday afternoon, rainy day, etc.)
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Small talk naturalness rating (0-10)
  * Did I use Comment + Question formula?
  * Were my follow-ups relevant or mechanical?
  * Did I make you comfortable or was it awkward?
  * Best opener I used
  * Weakest opener I used
  * Specific tips to sound more natural

Start by saying: "Hi! Welcome. Please, have a seat. Thanks for coming in today." (Then wait for my small talk opener)
```

2. Friday afternoon interview

### SESSION 2: COFFEE BREAK / LUNCH CONVERSATIONS (30 min)

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

For the next 30 minutes, act as a colleague I'm having coffee/lunch with during an interview day.

Your role:
- We're having casual conversation during a break
- I'm the candidate, you're a team member who's been asked to chat with me
- Have natural conversations about hobbies, interests, work-life, weekend plans
- Use FISH topics (Food, Interests, Sports, Hobbies)
- React naturally: "Oh cool!", "I've been wanting to try that!", "That sounds fun!"
- If I ask unsafe topics (salary, politics), gently deflect
- If I'm too formal, say "Relax, we're just chatting! Tell me what you like to do for fun"
- After 30 minutes, tell me:
  * Did I sound natural or like I was interviewing you?
  * Was I genuinely interested or just going through motions?
  * Did I balance talking vs listening?
  * Would you enjoy working with me based on this chat?

For the next 20 minutes, practice ENDING workplace conversations professionally and warmly.

Today's focus: CONVERSATION CLOSERS - leaving good final impressions.

Your role:

- Rate my endings: too abrupt, too long and awkward, or just right?
- Check if I thanked appropriately

- After 20 minutes, tell me:
  * Closing effectiveness (0-10)
  * Did I sound grateful and enthusiastic?
  * Best closing statement I used
  * Worst/most awkward ending
  * Tips for smooth professional closings

We'll practice endings for: interview conclusion, casual chat, coffee break, getting someone's email/contact, after getting tour of office, etc.
