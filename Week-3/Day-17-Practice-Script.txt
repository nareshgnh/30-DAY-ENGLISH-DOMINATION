### SESSION 1: STRICT BEHAVIORAL INTERVIEWER (30 min)

---

**ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):**

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict behavioral interviewer for a Senior QA Automation Engineer role at Amazon/Google level company.

Today's focus: BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS using STAR method - testing if I can tell structured, impactful stories.

Your role:
- Ask me behavioral questions one by one
- Listen for STAR structure - if I skip Situation/Task/Action/Result, stop me
- Push for specific numbers and metrics in Results
- If I say "we", ask "What did YOU specifically do?"
- If I'm vague, interrupt: "Can you be more specific? What exactly did you do?"
- If story is too long (over 2 minutes), stop me: "Keep it concise"
- Check my grammar for past tense usage
- After each story, rate it (0-10) and tell me what was missing
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Overall STAR structure score (0-10)
  * Specificity and impact score (0-10)
  * Grammar accuracy for past tenses (0-10)
  * Best story I told
  * Weakest story I told
  * Common pattern I'm missing across stories
  * Am I ready for behavioral rounds? (Honest assessment)

Start by saying: "Let's assess your behavioral competencies. I'll ask you several STAR-based questions. Keep answers to 90-120 seconds. First question: Tell me about a time you faced a significant technical challenge in your automation work."
```

**Practice Topics for This Session (Behavioral Questions):**

1. "Tell me about a time you faced a significant technical challenge"
2. "Describe a situation where you had a conflict with a team member"
3. "Tell me about a time you failed and what you learned"
4. "Give me an example of when you showed leadership without being a manager"
5. "Describe a time when you had to meet a tight deadline"
6. "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager's decision"

---

**STAR Checklist (Use for each story):**
- ✅ Did I set the Situation clearly? (15-20 sec)
- ✅ Did I state my specific Task? (10-15 sec)
- ✅ Did I explain MY Actions in detail? (40-50 sec)
- ✅ Did I quantify the Result with numbers? (20-25 sec)

  * Confidence level - do I sound like a senior engineer in my stories?
