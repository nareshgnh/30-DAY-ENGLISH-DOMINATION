### TOP 10 PRESSURE QUESTIONS + HOW TO ANSWER

---

**1. SALARY EXPECTATION**

**Question:** "What are your salary expectations?"

**Strategy:** Give a range based on research, show flexibility, mention value over money.

**Answer Template:**
"Based on my 6 years of experience in QA automation and current market standards for this role, I'm looking at a range of 20 to 25 LPA. However, I'm flexible and would love to understand the complete compensation package. I value growth opportunities and company culture as much as salary."

**Key Grammar:** "I'm looking at..." (present continuous for current search), "I would love to..." (polite)

---

**2. BIGGEST WEAKNESS**

**Question:** "What's your biggest weakness?"

**Strategy:** Pick a REAL weakness, show you're self-aware, explain how you're improving it.

**Answer Template:**
"My biggest weakness used to be public speaking and presenting to large groups. I would get nervous before team presentations. However, I recognized this and have been actively working on it. I've started volunteering to present in team meetings and have taken an online course on communication skills. I've seen significant improvement over the past year."

**Key Point:** "Used to be" + "I have been working on it" = Past problem + Current improvement

**3. WHY ARE YOU LEAVING YOUR CURRENT JOB?**

**Question:** "Why do you want to leave your current company?"

**Strategy:** Be positive, focus on what you're seeking (growth), not what you're escaping (bad manager).

**Answer Template:**
"I've had a great experience at HCL and have learned a lot. However, I'm now looking for opportunities to work on larger-scale systems and newer technologies. I'm particularly interested in product-based companies where I can have more impact on the end product. This role aligns perfectly with my career goals."

**Avoid:** Badmouthing current company, complaining about manager, focusing only on money.

---

**4. GAP IN RESUME**

**Question:** "I notice you have a gap in your resume from June to December 2022. Can you explain that?"

**Strategy:** Be honest, brief, pivot to what you did during that time.

**Answer Template:**
"That gap was due to personal family circumstances that required my attention. During that time, I stayed current with technology by taking online courses in Playwright and AWS. I used that period productively to upskill, and I'm now ready to fully commit to a new role."

**Key:** Don't over-explain, show you stayed productive, demonstrate you're ready now.

---

**5. BIGGEST FAILURE**

**Question:** "Tell me about your biggest professional failure."

**Strategy:** Pick a real failure, take ownership, emphasize the lesson learned.

**Answer Template:**
"Early in my career, I automated a test suite without proper planning, and it turned out to be extremely flaky with about 40% failure rate. It hurt team trust in automation. I took full ownership, analyzed the root causes, and rebuilt it properly using best practices. The success rate improved to 95%. This taught me the importance of proper planning and understanding tools deeply before implementation. I haven't repeated that mistake since."

**Key:** Failure + Ownership + Fix + Lesson = Strong Answer

---

**6. WHY SHOULD WE HIRE YOU?**

**Question:** "Why should we hire you over other candidates?"

**Strategy:** Confident but not arrogant. Mention unique value you bring.

**Answer Template:**
"I believe I bring a strong combination of technical automation expertise and collaborative team skills. I have 6 years of hands-on experience with modern tools like Playwright and strong CI/CD knowledge. Beyond technical skills, I've demonstrated leadership by building frameworks from scratch and mentoring junior engineers. I'm confident I can contribute immediately while also growing with the team."

**Key Grammar:** "I believe..." (shows confidence), "I have demonstrated..." (proof)

---

**7. OVERQUALIFIED FOR THIS ROLE**

**Question:** "You seem overqualified for this position. Why are you interested?"

**Strategy:** Show genuine interest, explain what attracts you, assure long-term commitment.

**Answer Template:**
"I understand the concern. What attracts me to this role is [specific aspect - technology/product/team]. While I may have extensive experience, I see this as an opportunity to apply my expertise in [specific area] and grow in [specific direction]. I'm looking for the right fit, not just any senior position, and this role aligns with my interests."

---

**8. HOW DO YOU HANDLE CRITICISM?**

**Question:** "How do you handle criticism or negative feedback?"

**Strategy:** Show maturity, give example, show you value feedback for growth.

**Answer Template:**
"I view criticism as an opportunity to improve. For example, my manager once pointed out that my test documentation could be more detailed. Instead of being defensive, I asked for specific examples and improved my documentation standards. I regularly ask for feedback because I believe it's essential for professional growth."

---

**9. WORKING WITH DIFFICULT PERSON**

**Question:** "Tell me about a time you worked with a difficult colleague."

**Strategy:** Show professionalism, focus on resolution, don't badmouth anyone.

**Answer Template:**
"I once worked with a developer who was dismissive of test findings. Instead of escalating immediately, I scheduled a one-on-one to understand his perspective. I learned he felt pressured by deadlines. We agreed on a process where I flagged critical bugs immediately and minor issues post-release. The relationship improved significantly, and we became effective collaborators."

**Key:** Problem + Empathy + Solution + Result

---

**10. SALARY AT CURRENT JOB**

**Question:** "What's your current salary?"

**Strategy:** Be honest if required, but try to deflect to expectations.

**Answer Template:**
"I'm currently at [X] LPA. However, I'm more focused on the overall opportunity, growth potential, and the value I can bring rather than just the salary increment. I'm open to discussing a fair package based on the role's requirements and my experience."

2. **Turn Negatives to Positives:** Every weakness/failure should include improvement.
