# DAY 18 QUICK REFERENCE: WORKPLACE SMALL TALK

---

## ⚡ TOP 5 SMALL TALK RULES

**Rule 1:** Use Comment + Question formula
- ✅ "Great weather today, isn't it? How was your weekend?"
- ✅ "Nice office space! How long have you been working here?"

**Rule 2:** FISH topics are safe (Food, Interests, Sports, Hobbies)
- ✅ Weekend plans, hobbies, weather, food, sports, technology, commute
- ❌ Salary, politics, religion, gossip

**Rule 3:** Active listening = Ask follow-up questions
- ✅ Them: "I like cycling" → You: "Oh nice! How long have you been cycling?"
- ❌ Them: "I like cycling" → You: "Cool. Do you like coding?"

**Rule 4:** Small talk BEFORE business, especially in interviews
- ✅ 2-3 min rapport building → then technical questions
- ❌ Jumping straight to "Tell me about yourself"

**Rule 5:** End conversations warmly
- ✅ "Thanks so much for your time! Looking forward to hearing from you!"
- ❌ Abrupt: "OK bye" or awkwardly lingering

## ❌ TOP 5 MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. ❌ No small talk, straight to business → ✅ Build rapport first 2-3 minutes

2. ❌ Asking unsafe topics (salary, politics) → ✅ Stick to FISH topics

3. ❌ Mechanical questions with no follow-ups → ✅ Listen and ask relevant follow-ups

4. ❌ Only asking questions, never sharing → ✅ Balance asking and sharing about yourself

5. ❌ Too formal in casual settings → ✅ Match the energy (casual coffee ≠ formal interview)
