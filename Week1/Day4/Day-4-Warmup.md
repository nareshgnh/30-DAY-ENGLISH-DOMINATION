# DAY 4 - WARMUP (15-20 min)

**File Name:** Day-4-Warmup.txt

## CONFIDENCE BOOST STATEMENT:

**Day 4! You're already 13% done! Today's topic is SNEAKY but POWERFUL. Articles (a, an, the) seem small, but they make you sound like a NATIVE speaker. Indians skip articles because we don't have them in Hindi/Telugu/Tamil. But by tonight, you'll use them PERFECTLY. This is the difference between sounding robotic and sounding FLUENT. Let's master the invisible magic of English! 🎯**

## BREATHING EXERCISE (2 min):

**Exercise 1: Precision Breathing**
- Breathe in for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts
- Breathe out for 4 counts
- As you breathe out, say: "I am a fluent English speaker. I use the right articles naturally."

**Exercise 2: Article Breathing**
- Deep breath in
- On the exhale, say smoothly: "I am a QA engineer. I work on the automation framework. I test applications."
- Repeat 3 times, feeling the flow

**Exercise 3: Confidence Breathing**
- Quick breath in
- Powerful exhale: "Articles are easy. I will master them TODAY!"
- Repeat 3 times with energy

## WARM-UP SENTENCES (5 min):

**Read these aloud 3 times each. Notice the articles (or lack of them).**

1. I am a QA Automation Engineer with 6 years of experience.

2. I work on the testing framework at my company.

3. Automation is the future of software testing.

4. I found a bug in the payment module yesterday.

5. The bug I found was critical, so I reported it to the team lead.

**Why these sentences?** They show "a" (one of many), "the" (specific one), and zero article (general concept)!

---

## TONGUE TWISTERS (3 min):

1. **"A tester tests the tests. The tester is testing a test."**
   (Focus on when to use "a" vs "the")

2. **"I found a bug, the bug was bad, the team fixed the bug fast."**
   (Focus on introducing (a) then referring to specific one (the))

3. **"Testing takes time. The testing process requires patience. A tester needs skills."**
   (Focus on zero article, the, a)

**Yesterday's Reminder:**
- "will" = spontaneous decision/opinion → "I will help you"
