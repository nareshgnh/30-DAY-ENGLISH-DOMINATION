2. **Can I explain when to use "the"?**
   - Answer: When it's specific, unique, or already mentioned

3. **Do I know when NOT to use articles?**

5. **Can I say my profession correctly?**

**If you can answer all 5 correctly and use them naturally, you're ready!**

## 🔮 TOMORROW'S PREVIEW: DAY 5

**Topic:** Prepositions (in, on, at, by, for)

**What to expect:**
You'll learn when to say "in the morning" vs "on Monday" vs "at 3 PM". Prepositions are SUPER tricky for Indians because we use them differently in our languages. You'll master "I work at TCS", "I live in Bangalore", "I'm good at testing" - all the tiny words that native speakers use perfectly.

**Pre-prep:**
Before tomorrow, notice how you use prepositions. Do you say "in Monday" or "on Monday"? "at Bangalore" or "in Bangalore"? You'll learn all the rules tomorrow!

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S GOAL

**Focus for Day 5:**
Master prepositions so you say "in the morning", "on Monday", "at 3 PM" perfectly. Prepositions are tiny but MIGHTY. They show native fluency. Tomorrow, you'll never confuse them again!

**Commitment:**
"Tomorrow, I am going to master prepositions. I will practice for 2 hours. Articles = ✅ done. Prepositions = next! I'm becoming more fluent every single day. Day 5, I'm ready!"

## 🚀 REMINDER

**Articles are THE secret to sounding native.**

When you say:
- "I am a QA engineer" (not "I am QA engineer")
- "I work on the framework" (not "I work on framework")
- "I know Python" (not "I know the Python")

You sound like a NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER.

That's worth ₹10,00,000 more in your package.

You just mastered the invisible magic today.

Tomorrow, you'll master the tiny connectors (prepositions).

By Day 30, you'll speak FLAWLESS English.

**KEEP GOING. YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE!**
