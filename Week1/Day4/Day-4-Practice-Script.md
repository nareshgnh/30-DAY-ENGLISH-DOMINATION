- Correct me strictly: "Stop. You need THE article here because it's specific. Try again."
- Don't accept vague answers
- Push me to use articles correctly in every sentence
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Article accuracy rating (0-10)

## MOTIVATION BOOST

**YOU JUST PRACTICED ARTICLES FOR 2 HOURS!**

Articles are THE hardest thing for Indian English speakers.

Why? Because we don't have them in our languages!

But you just:
- Practiced "a/an" for 2 hours
- Learned when to use "the"
- Mastered zero article for general concepts
- Used articles in interviews, meetings, and casual talk

**Most Indians NEVER master articles.**

You're mastering them in ONE DAY.

That's the difference between:
- ❌ "I am QA engineer with experience in testing" (sounds translated)
- ✅ "I am a QA engineer with experience in testing" (sounds native)

**The second one gets 25 LPA. That's YOU now.**

**Record this thought:**
"Today, I mastered the invisible magic of English. Articles seemed small, but they make HUGE difference. Now when I say 'I am A tester' vs 'I am THE tester', I know exactly which one to use. I sound more natural. I sound more fluent. I sound like a NATIVE SPEAKER."
