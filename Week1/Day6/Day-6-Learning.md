# DAY 6 - LEARNING FILE (1 hour)

**File Name:** Day-6-Learning.txt

**Topic:** COMMON GRAMMAR FIXES (Do/Does/Did, Have/Has/Had, Is/Are/Was/Were)

---

## SECTION 1: RULES & EXPLANATIONS

---

### CORE RULE 1: DO / DOES / DID - For Questions and Negatives

**Explanation:**
"Do", "does", and "did" are auxiliary (helping) verbs used for:
- Making questions in simple tenses
- Making negative sentences
- Emphasizing actions

**Rules:**
- **DO** = I, you, we, they (present)
- **DOES** = he, she, it (present)
- **DID** = all subjects (past)

**Structure:**
- Questions: Do/Does/Did + subject + base verb?
- Negatives: Subject + do/does/did + not + base verb
- Emphasis: Subject + do/does/did + base verb

**10 Examples:**

1. **I do automation testing every day.**
   (Emphasis on "do" - I really do it)

2. **He doesn't know Python.**
   (Negative with "does" for he/she/it)

3. **Do you have experience with Selenium?**
   (Question with "do" for you/we/they)

4. **She does manual testing sometimes.**
   (Emphasis for she/he/it)

5. **They don't work on weekends.**
   (Negative with "do" for they/we)

6. **Did you fix the bug yesterday?**
   (Question in past - "did" for all subjects)

7. **I didn't attend the meeting.**
   (Negative past - "didn't" + base verb)

8. **Does this test case cover all scenarios?**
   (Question with "does" for it/he/she)

9. **We do follow Agile methodology.**
   (Emphasis - we really do follow it)

10. **He didn't complete the automation on time.**
    (Negative past for he)

**Common Mistake Indians Make:**
❌ "He don't know Selenium"
✅ "He doesn't know Selenium"

❌ "She don't have experience"
✅ "She doesn't have experience"

❌ "Do he work here?"
✅ "Does he work here?"

❌ "I didn't worked on that project"
✅ "I didn't work on that project" (did + base verb, NOT did + past tense)

**Why?** In Hindi/Telugu, we don't change the auxiliary based on subject. We say "woh nahi jaanta" for both he/they. English requires "does" for he/she/it.

**Memory Trick:**
**"HE/SHE/IT = DOES | EVERYONE ELSE = DO | PAST = DID (for all)"**

**Quick Reference:**
- I do, I don't, Do I?
- You do, You don't, Do you?
- He/She/It does, He/She/It doesn't, Does he/she/it?
- We do, We don't, Do we?
- They do, They don't, Do they?
- ALL subjects did, ALL didn't, Did ALL?

---

### CORE RULE 2: HAVE / HAS / HAD - For Possession and Present Perfect

**Explanation:**
"Have", "has", and "had" are used for:
- Possession (having something)
- Present Perfect tense
- Experiences

**Rules:**
- **HAVE** = I, you, we, they (present)
- **HAS** = he, she, it (present)
- **HAD** = all subjects (past)

**10 Examples:**

1. **I have 6 years of experience in automation.**
   (Possession - I possess experience)

2. **She has excellent testing skills.**
   (Possession for she/he/it)

3. **We have a meeting at 3 PM.**
   (Possession - we possess a scheduled meeting)

4. **He has worked on multiple projects.**
   (Present Perfect for he/she/it)

5. **They have completed the regression testing.**
   (Present Perfect for they/we)

6. **I had a bug in my code yesterday.**
   (Past possession)

7. **She had worked at Infosys before joining TCS.**
   (Past Perfect)

8. **Do you have experience with Playwright?**
   (Question using "do have")

9. **It has been a challenging week.**
   (Present Perfect for it)

10. **We had finished testing before the deployment.**
    (Past Perfect)

**Common Mistake Indians Make:**
❌ "She have 5 years of experience"
✅ "She has 5 years of experience"

❌ "He have knowledge of Python"
✅ "He has knowledge of Python"

❌ "I have went to the office" (have + past tense)
✅ "I have gone to the office" (have + past participle)

❌ "She don't have experience"
✅ "She doesn't have experience"

**Why?** We use one form for all subjects in our languages. English changes "have" to "has" for he/she/it.

**Memory Trick:**
**"HE/SHE/IT HAS | EVERYONE ELSE HAVE | PAST = HAD (all)"**

**Quick Reference:**
- I have, I don't have, I have done
- You have, You don't have, You have done
- He/She/It has, He/She/It doesn't have, He/She/It has done
- We have, We don't have, We have done
- They have, They don't have, They have done
- ALL subjects had, ALL didn't have, ALL had done

---

### CORE RULE 3: IS / ARE / WAS / WERE - "To Be" Verb

**Explanation:**
"Is", "are", "was", "were" are forms of "to be" used for:
- Describing states (I am happy, he is busy)
- Continuous tenses (I am working, they were testing)
- Passive voice (It is done, they were tested)

**Rules:**
**Present:**
- **AM** = I (only)
- **IS** = he, she, it
- **ARE** = you, we, they

**Past:**
- **WAS** = I, he, she, it
- **WERE** = you, we, they

**10 Examples:**

1. **I am a QA Automation Engineer.**
   (Present state - I)

2. **He is working on the test framework.**
   (Present continuous for he/she/it)

3. **They are testing the new feature.**
   (Present continuous for they/we/you)

4. **The application is running on the server.**
   (Present state for it)

5. **We are responsible for quality assurance.**
   (Present state for we/they)

6. **I was testing the application yesterday.**
   (Past continuous - I)

7. **She was the lead QA in her previous company.**
   (Past state for she/he/it)

8. **They were debugging the issue all day.**
   (Past continuous for they/we/you)

9. **The tests were failing due to a configuration error.**
   (Past state for plural)

10. **You were right about that bug.**
    (Past state for you - always "were")

**Common Mistake Indians Make:**
❌ "He are a tester"
✅ "He is a tester"

❌ "They was testing yesterday"
✅ "They were testing yesterday"

❌ "I is working on automation"
✅ "I am working on automation"

❌ "She are good at coding"
✅ "She is good at coding"

❌ "You was at the meeting"
✅ "You were at the meeting" (You is ALWAYS "are/were", never "is/was")

**Why?** We don't conjugate "to be" in our languages the same way. We might say "woh hai" for both "he is" and "they are".

**Memory Trick:**
**"I AM, YOU ARE, HE/SHE/IT IS, WE/THEY ARE"**
**"I/HE/SHE/IT WAS, YOU/WE/THEY WERE"**

**Quick Reference:**
Present: I am, You are, He/She/It is, We are, They are
Past: I was, You were, He/She/It was, We were, They were
Negative: I'm not, You aren't, He/She/It isn't, We aren't, They aren't
Question: Am I?, Are you?, Is he/she/it?, Are we?, Are they?

### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR INTERVIEWS:

**Interviewers IMMEDIATELY notice these errors:**

❌ "I has 6 years of experience"
✅ "I have 6 years of experience"

❌ "He don't know Python"
✅ "He doesn't know Python"

❌ "They was working on that project"
✅ "They were working on that project"

❌ "She don't have experience with Selenium"
✅ "She doesn't have experience with Selenium"

**These tiny errors = NON-FLUENT = Interview rejection**
**Perfect auxiliaries = NATIVE-LEVEL = Interview success**

---

### WHY THIS MATTERS FOR WORKPLACE:

**Daily communication:**

**Wrong:**
❌ "He don't know about the bug"
❌ "She have completed the testing"
❌ "They was in the meeting"

**Right:**
✅ "He doesn't know about the bug"
✅ "She has completed the testing"
✅ "They were in the meeting"

**Perfect grammar = Professional = Respected colleague**
