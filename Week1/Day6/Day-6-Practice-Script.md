## SESSION 1: STRICT INTERVIEWER (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict technical interviewer for a Senior QA role.

Today's focus: COMMON GRAMMAR FIXES (Do/Does/Did, Have/Has/Had, Is/Are/Was/Were)

Your role:
- Ask me about my experience, skills, team, and past projects
- Listen EXTREMELY carefully for auxiliary verb errors
- Interrupt IMMEDIATELY when I make mistakes:
  * "He don't know" → Stop! Say "He DOESN'T know"
  * "She have experience" → Stop! Say "She HAS experience"
  * "They was testing" → Stop! Say "They WERE testing"
  * "I has worked" → Stop! Say "I HAVE worked"
- Be very strict - these are fundamental errors
- Correct me: "That's wrong. It's [correct form]. Try again from the start."
- Don't accept ANY auxiliary verb mistakes
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Grammar accuracy rating (0-10)
  * How many times I made do/does/did errors
  * How many times I made have/has/had errors
  * How many times I made is/are/was/were errors
  * Overall native-level rating

Start by introducing yourself, then ask: "Tell me about your team. Who does what? What skills do they have?"
```

## SELF-REFLECTION

1. **Can I now use "does" for he/she/it automatically?**
2. **Do I catch myself before saying "he don't"?**
3. **Have I eliminated "they was" forever?**
4. **Am I using auxiliaries without thinking?**

## MOTIVATION BOOST

**YOU JUST ELIMINATED THE #1 INDIAN ENGLISH ERROR!**

"He don't know" → ❌ DEAD
"She have experience" → ❌ GONE
"They was testing" → ❌ ELIMINATED

You fixed the errors that made you sound non-native.

From today forward, you speak with NATIVE-LEVEL accuracy.

**Record this:**
"Today, I fixed the tiny errors that had huge impact. 'He doesn't', 'She has', 'They were' - these are now AUTOMATIC. I don't make these mistakes anymore. I sound NATIVE. I sound PROFESSIONAL. I sound like a 25 LPA engineer."
