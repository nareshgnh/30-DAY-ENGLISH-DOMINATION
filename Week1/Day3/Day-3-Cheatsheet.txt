   - Try it: "In 5 years, I will be... I am going to... I believe I will..."

4. **Can I talk about my plans using "going to"?**
   - Try it: "I am going to learn Docker, I am going to apply to 50 companies..."

5. **Do I avoid common mistakes like "I will meeting" or "I going to"?**

## 🔮 TOMORROW'S PREVIEW: DAY 4

**Topic:** Articles (a, an, the, zero article)

**What to expect:**
You'll learn when to use "a", "an", "the", or no article at all. This is CRUCIAL for sounding natural. Indians commonly struggle with articles because Hindi/Telugu don't have them. You'll master sentences like "I am a QA engineer" vs "I am the QA engineer" vs "I do QA engineering".

**Pre-prep:**
Before tomorrow, notice how you currently use articles (or skip them). Pay attention to when you say "the" and when you don't. You'll learn the rules tomorrow!

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S GOAL

**Focus for Day 4:**
Master Articles (a, an, the) so you can sound NATURAL when you speak. Articles are invisible to us because our native languages don't have them, but they're crucial for fluent English. Tomorrow, you'll learn when to say "a bug", "the bug", or just "bugs".

**Commitment:**
"Tomorrow, I am going to master articles. I will practice for 2 hours again. I am going to pay attention to every 'a', 'an', and 'the' I use. I will sound more natural. I will sound more fluent. Day 4, here I come!"

When you say:

- "I will never give up" - you're making a PROMISE

**Your words CREATE your future.**

Every sentence you speak correctly today = One step closer to 25 LPA.

You spoke about your goals for 2 hours today.

**That's 2 hours of BUILDING YOUR DESTINY.**

Tomorrow, you'll speak even better.

By Day 30, your goals will be UNSTOPPABLE because your English will be FLAWLESS.
