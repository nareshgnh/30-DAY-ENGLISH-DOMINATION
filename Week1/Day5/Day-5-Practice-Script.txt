## MOTIVATION BOOST

**YOU JUST PRACTICED PREPOSITIONS FOR 2 HOURS!**

Prepositions are THE trickiest part for Indian speakers.

Why? Because we use ONE word in Hindi/Telugu/Tamil for ALL situations.

But you just:
- Learned IN/ON/AT for time
- Mastered IN/ON/AT for place
- Practiced BY/FOR/WITH/ABOUT
- Used prepositions in work history, schedules, skills

**Most Indians NEVER get prepositions right.**

"I work in TCS in Monday in 3 PM" ← Common Indian English

"I work at TCS. I have a meeting on Monday at 3 PM." ← Native English

**The second one gets 25 LPA. That's YOU now.**

**Record this thought:**
"Today, I conquered the tiny connectors that make HUGE difference. Prepositions seemed small, but they show native precision. Now when I say 'at TCS', 'in Bangalore', 'on Monday', 'at 3 PM' - I get it PERFECT. I sound native. I sound professional. I'm 17% done with this program. My English is getting FLAWLESS."
