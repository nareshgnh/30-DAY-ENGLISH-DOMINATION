## 🔮 TOMORROW'S PREVIEW: DAY 6

**Topic:** Common Grammar Fixes (Do/Does/Did, Have/Has/Had, Is/Are/Was/Were)

**What to expect:**
You'll master the most common auxiliary verbs that Indians mess up. "He don't know" vs "He doesn't know", "She have experience" vs "She has experience", "They was testing" vs "They were testing". These tiny errors destroy your fluency. Tomorrow, you'll fix them FOREVER.

**Pre-prep:**
Before tomorrow, notice when you use do/does, have/has, is/are. Do you say "He don't" or "He doesn't"? You'll perfect it tomorrow!

## 🎯 TOMORROW'S GOAL

**Focus for Day 6:**
Fix common auxiliary verb mistakes forever. "Does" vs "do", "has" vs "have", "is" vs "are" - these tiny errors scream "non-native". Tomorrow, you'll eliminate them completely!

**Commitment:**
"Tomorrow, I'm going to master auxiliary verbs. I will say 'He doesn't' not 'He don't'. I will say 'She has' not 'She have'. These tiny fixes = HUGE fluency boost. Day 6, I'm ready!"

## 🚀 REMINDER

**Prepositions = Native precision**

When you say:
- "I work AT TCS IN Bangalore" (not "I work in TCS at Bangalore")
- "I have a meeting ON Monday AT 3 PM" (not "in Monday at 3 PM")
- "I'm good AT automation" (not "good in automation")

You sound EXACTLY like a native English speaker.

That precision = 25 LPA communication.

You conquered prepositions today.

Tomorrow, you'll conquer auxiliary verbs.

By Day 7, Week 1 will be COMPLETE.

**YOU'RE UNSTOPPABLE! KEEP GOING!**
