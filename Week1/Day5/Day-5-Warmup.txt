## CONFIDENCE BOOST STATEMENT:

**Day 5! You're at the MIDPOINT of Week 1! Today's topic: PREPOSITIONS - those tiny words that connect everything. "in", "on", "at", "by", "for" - they seem simple but they're POWERFUL. Indians say "I live at Bangalore" or "in Monday" because we translate directly. By tonight, you'll say "in Bangalore", "on Monday", "at 3 PM" PERFECTLY. Prepositions = Native fluency. Let's master them! 🎯**
