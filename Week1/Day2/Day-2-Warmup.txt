## WARM-UP SENTENCES (5 min):

**Read these aloud 3 times each. Notice the different past tenses.**

1. I worked at Infosys for 3 years before joining TCS.

2. I have worked on multiple automation projects throughout my career.

3. Last month, I was working on the payment module when I discovered a critical bug.

4. I fixed the bug, tested it thoroughly, and deployed the solution.

5. I have never faced such a challenging issue before, but I learned from it.

**Why these sentences?** They demonstrate Past Simple (completed actions), Present Perfect (life experiences), and Past Continuous (background actions). You'll master all three today!

## TONGUE TWISTERS (3 min):

**Practice each 5 times. Focus on past tense verb endings (-ed sounds).**

1. **"I tested, retested, and requested the latest test data yesterday."**
   (Focus on -ed endings: /ɪd/, /t/, /d/ sounds)

2. **"She developed, deployed, and documented the deprecated code last week."**
   (Focus on rhythm and past tense consistency)

3. **"I've worked, I've learned, I've earned expert experience."**
   (Focus on "have" + past participle)

**Tip:** The -ed ending can sound like /t/, /d/, or /ɪd/ depending on the verb. Listen to yourself!

## QUICK GRAMMAR RECALL (5 min):

**Yesterday's Reminder:**
- Present Simple = habits/facts → "I work as a QA Engineer"
- Present Continuous = now/temporary → "I am learning Playwright"
- State verbs = Simple only → "I know", NOT "I am knowing"

**Today's Preview:**

**You'll learn:**
- Past Simple vs Present Perfect vs Past Continuous - when to use each
- How to tell interview stories using PAST TENSES correctly
- Common mistakes: "I am working there since 2019" ← WRONG!
- How to talk about completed projects, previous jobs, and career achievements
- 30+ past tense examples from QA/tech industry

**Quick Test:** What's the difference?
- "I worked at TCS" ← When do you use this?
- "I have worked at TCS" ← When do you use this?
- "I was working at TCS" ← When do you use this?

*By the end of today, you'll know EXACTLY when to use each one!*

## ENERGY STATEMENT:

**"DAY 2, LET'S DOMINATE! Yesterday I learned present tenses. Today I master past tenses. Tomorrow I'll own future tenses. I'm building my 25 LPA English brick by brick. Every story I tell today in correct past tense is PROOF I'm interview-ready. Interviewers ask about PAST EXPERIENCE - and I'm about to become a MASTER at talking about it! BRING IT ON!"**

**NOW PROCEED TO:** Day-2-Learning.txt

**Remember:** You're not just learning grammar. You're learning how to SELL YOUR EXPERIENCE in interviews. Past tense = Your career story = Your VALUE = Your SALARY.

Master this, and you'll command respect in every interview.

**TIME CHECK:** Did you complete the warmup in 15-20 minutes? If yes, great! If you rushed, slow down - the warmup activates your brain for learning. If it took longer, that's fine too - you're building habits.

**MINDSET:** Day 2 is about STORYTELLING. In interviews, they'll ask: "Tell me about a time when..." - and your answer needs perfect past tense. Today, you become a storyteller.

**LET'S GO TO THE LEARNING SESSION!**
