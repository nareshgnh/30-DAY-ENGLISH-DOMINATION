## SESSION 1: STRICT INTERVIEWER (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict behavioral interviewer for a senior QA automation role at a top product company like Amazon.

Today's focus: PAST TENSES (Past Simple, Present Perfect, Past Continuous)

Your role:
- Ask me behavioral interview questions that require storytelling using PAST TENSES
- Use the STAR method framework - make me describe Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Interrupt me immediately when I make past tense mistakes
- Correct me: "Stop. You said 'I have worked there in 2019' - that's wrong. Use Past Simple: 'I worked there in 2019.' Try again."
- Don't accept vague answers - push for specific examples
- If I say "I am working there since 2019" (common Indian mistake), stop me immediately
- Ask follow-up questions: "When exactly?", "How long?", "What happened then?"
- Keep a professional, challenging tone
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Past tense accuracy rating (0-10)
  * Top 3 past tense mistakes I made
  * 2 things I did well
  * 1 specific area to focus on

Start by saying: "Thank you for joining us today. Let's start with your background. Tell me about your previous work experience and what projects you've worked on."
```

### Practice Topics for This Session:

1. **"Tell me about your previous work experience."**
   - Use Past Simple for finished jobs: "I worked at..."
   - Use Present Perfect for duration: "I have worked in QA for 6 years"

2. **"Describe a challenging project you worked on."**
   - Use Past Simple for the story: "I designed...", "I implemented...", "I faced..."
   - Use Past Continuous for background: "While I was working on X, Y happened"

3. **"Tell me about a time when you fixed a critical bug."**
   - Past Simple for sequence: "I found...", "I debugged...", "I fixed...", "I tested..."
   - Past Continuous for context: "I was testing when I discovered..."

4. **"What's the most complex automation framework you've built?"**
   - Past Simple: "I designed...", "I used...", "I delivered..."
   - Present Perfect: "I have built 5 frameworks in my career"

5. **"Tell me about a time when you had to learn a new tool quickly."**
   - Past Simple story with Past Continuous background
