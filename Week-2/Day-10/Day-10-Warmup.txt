This is the day everything changes. Ready to break through?"

**Yesterday's Key Rule Reminder (Day 9):**
- You learned professional phrases: "In my opinion", "From my experience", "I'm confident that"

**Today's Preview:**
- Today is about THINKING - the mental process behind speaking
- You'll learn to stop the mental translation step
- You'll develop English thought patterns
- Thinking in English = The fastest path to fluency

**Key Concept for Today:**
STOP: Telugu/Hindi → English translation → Speaking
START: English thinking → Speaking directly

**Mental Switch Exercise:**
- Think right now in your native language: "నేను టెస్టింగ్ చేస్తున్నాను" / "मैं टेस्टिंग कर रहा हूं"
- Now think directly in English: "I'm doing testing"
- Feel the difference? Today you'll make the English way automatic.
