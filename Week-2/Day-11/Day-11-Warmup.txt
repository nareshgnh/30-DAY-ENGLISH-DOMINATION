## QUICK GRAMMAR RECALL (5 min):

**Yesterday's Key Rule Reminder (Day 10):**
- You learned to THINK in English without translation
- You can now respond quickly and naturally
- Day 10 was about SPEED and FLOW

**Today's Preview:**
- Today is about CLARITY - how you pronounce words
- You'll master problem sounds for Indians: TH, V/W, R, ending consonants
- You'll learn word stress patterns
- Pronunciation + Stress = Professional Sound

**Common Indian Pronunciation Issues:**
- TH → T/D: "Think" becomes "Tink"
- V → W: "Very" becomes "Wery"
- Missing ending consonants: "Test" becomes "Tes"
- Wrong stress: "AUtoMAtion" becomes "autoMAtion"

**Today's Goal:** Fix these, sound clear and professional!

Every word I stress correctly makes me sound more fluent. I'm 37% done with my 30-day transformation. Clear speech = Clear communication = Interview SUCCESS! Let's make every syllable count! 25 LPA CLARITY!"
