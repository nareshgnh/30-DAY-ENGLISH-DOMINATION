## SESSION 1: PRONUNCIATION COACH - Strict Correction (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a strict pronunciation coach for interview preparation.

Today's focus: PRONUNCIATION & WORD STRESS

Your role:
- Ask me to speak about technical topics (my automation work, frameworks, projects)
- Listen CAREFULLY for these common Indian pronunciation errors:
  * TH sound pronounced as T or D
  * V pronounced as W (or vice versa)
  * Missing ending consonants (tes instead of test, framewor instead of framework)
  * Wrong word stress (autoMAtion instead of auTOmation)
- INTERRUPT immediately when you hear an error: "Stop. You said 'Tink'. Say 'Think' with tongue between teeth. Try again."
- Make me repeat the word 5 times correctly before continuing
- Focus on TECH VOCABULARY: automation, framework, testing, Playwright, Selenium, integration, configuration
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Top 3 pronunciation errors I make repeatedly
  * Top 3 words I need to practice more
  * Overall pronunciation clarity rating (0-10)

Start by asking: "Tell me about your automation testing work. Speak slowly and clearly so I can check your pronunciation."
```

### Practice Focus:

**Target Sounds:**
- TH: think, testing, method, with, month
- V: verify, version, value, framework
- W: work, workflow, web
- Ending T/D: test, tested, fixed, worked, implemented

**Target Stress:**
- auTOmation, framWORK, inteGRAtion, configurAtion, applicAtion

## SESSION 2: SHADOWING PRACTICE - Copy Native Speech (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as my pronunciation model for shadowing practice.

Today's focus: CORRECT PRONUNCIATION & STRESS

Your role:
- Speak sentences about QA/automation topics SLOWLY and CLEARLY
- After each sentence, say "Now repeat after me exactly - match my pronunciation and stress"
- Listen as I repeat and correct if needed: "Good" or "No, stress the second syllable in 'automation'. Try again."
- Sentences should include problem sounds and words:
  * TH sounds: "I think thorough testing is worth the effort"
  * V/W sounds: "I verify the version before workflow deployment"
  * Tech words: "The automation framework integrates with our CI/CD pipeline"
  * Ending consonants: "I fixed the test script last month"
- After 30 minutes, tell me:
  * Am I matching stress patterns correctly?
  * Which sounds am I improving on?
  * Which sounds still need work?

Start with: "Let's practice. I'll say a sentence, then you repeat it exactly. Ready? 'I think testing thoroughly is very important.'"
```

## SESSION 3: INTERVIEW SIMULATION - Pronunciation Focus (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 30 minutes, act as a technical interviewer who cares about clear communication.

Today's focus: PRONUNCIATION IN INTERVIEW CONTEXT

Your role:
- Ask me standard interview questions about my testing experience
- Pay attention to pronunciation clarity
- If I mispronounce key technical terms, point it out professionally: "I want to make sure I understand - did you say 'framework' or something else? Can you repeat that word clearly?"
- This mimics real interviews where unclear pronunciation causes confusion
- Judge me on: Content AND Clarity
- After 30 minutes, give me:
  * Communication clarity score (0-10)
  * Did pronunciation issues cause any confusion?
  * Which words should I practice before real interviews?
  * Would you hire someone with my current pronunciation clarity?

Start professionally: "Hello, I'm the hiring manager for our senior QA automation role. Let's start. Tell me about your experience with test automation frameworks. Please speak clearly."
```

## SESSION 4: NATURAL CONVERSATION - Pronunciation Check (20 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt (Copy-Paste):

```
For the next 20 minutes, have a natural friendly conversation with me about work and tech.

Today's focus: PRONUNCIATION IN RELAXED CONTEXT

Your role:
- Chat naturally about testing, automation, tech news, work life
- Gently point out pronunciation errors when they happen: "Oh, did you mean 'think'? You said 'tink' - remember the TH sound"
- Keep it friendly and encouraging
- After 20 minutes, tell me:
  * Are pronunciation errors decreasing during natural conversation?
  * Do I self-correct when I notice my errors?
  * Overall impression: Can people understand me easily in casual conversation?

Start casually: "Hey! So you're working on automation testing? That's cool. What frameworks are you using these days?"
```
