## SESSION 1: DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt:

```
For 30 minutes, simulate difficult workplace scenarios where I must communicate professionally.

Your roles (rotate):
1. Developer who wants to skip testing
2. Manager with unrealistic timelines
3. Stakeholder who doesn't understand QA value
4. Teammate whose code has issues

For each scenario:
- Present the difficult situation
- Let me respond professionally
- If I'm too direct/rude, say "That might come across as confrontational. Try rephrasing politely."
- If I'm too weak, say "Stand your ground more. Be polite but firm."
- If perfect, say "That's professional and effective!"

After 30 min:
- Rate my professional communication (0-10)
- Best response I gave
- Response that needs improvement

Start: "Hey, I know testing is important, but this is a tiny change. Can we just skip testing and deploy it? We're already behind schedule."
```

## SESSION 2: MEETING SIMULATION (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt:

```
For 30 minutes, simulate a sprint planning meeting.

Your role: You're the team lead running the meeting. There are other team members (you play them too).

My role: QA automation engineer participating in planning

Scenarios in the meeting:
- I need to contribute ideas professionally
- I need to disagree with a risky plan politely
- I need to clarify requirements
- I need to commit to deliverables realistically
- I need to summarize action items

Listen for:
- Professional phrases ("I'd like to suggest...", "Just to clarify...")
- Polite disagreement
- Clear communication

After meeting:
- Did I sound professional?
- Did I contribute effectively?
- Did I handle disagreements well?

Start: "Good morning everyone! Let's start sprint planning. We have 15 story points to plan. QA, what's your capacity this sprint?"
```

## SESSION 3: FEEDBACK PRACTICE (30 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt:

```
For 30 minutes, practice giving and receiving feedback professionally.

Part 1 (15 min): I give feedback to you (play a junior tester)
- You wrote flaky tests
- Your code lacks comments
- You haven't been attending standups

Part 2 (15 min): You give me feedback
- My automation is too slow
- My tests lack coverage
- I've been missing deadlines

Listen for:
- Do I use constructive language?
- Do I use the sandwich method (positive-improvement-positive)?
- Am I specific or vague?
- Do I receive feedback gracefully?

After 30 min:
- Feedback delivery score (0-10)
- Feedback reception score (0-10)
- Key improvements needed

Start Part 1: "Hey, I'm the junior tester. I heard you wanted to give me some feedback?"
```

## SESSION 4: CLIENT/STAKEHOLDER COMMUNICATION (20 min)

### ChatGPT Setup Prompt:

```
For 20 minutes, I'm presenting to a non-technical stakeholder.

You play: Product Manager who doesn't understand testing deeply

I need to:
- Explain why automation takes time
- Justify not having 100% coverage
- Communicate a testing delay professionally
- Explain technical issues in simple terms

Listen for:
- Do I communicate clearly to non-technical audience?
- Do I justify professionally?
- Do I manage expectations?

After 20 min:
- Clarity of communication (0-10)
- Would I, as a PM, trust this QA engineer?

Start: "So, you're saying automation will take 3 months? Why so long? Can't we just automate everything faster?"
```
