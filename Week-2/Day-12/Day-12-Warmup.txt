## CONFIDENCE BOOST STATEMENT:

"Day 12! You think in English, you pronounce clearly. Now you learn to tell COMPELLING stories. The STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) is THE framework for behavioral interviews. Master this today, and you'll answer ANY 'Tell me about a time when...' question perfectly. Stories sell. Data tells. Today you become a master storyteller. 25 LPA candidates don't just answer questions - they tell stories that make interviewers say 'WE WANT THIS PERSON!'"

## QUICK GRAMMAR RECALL (5 min):

**Yesterday's Reminder (Day 11):**
- You mastered pronunciation: TH, V/W, word stress, ending consonants
- You speak clearly now
- Day 11 was about CLARITY

**Today's Preview:**
- Today is about STRUCTURE - how to organize your interview stories
- STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result
- Every behavioral question gets this structure
- Structure = Professional communication

**Why STAR?**
Interviewers want specific examples, not vague statements.
❌ "I'm good at debugging" - Vague
✅ "SITUATION: We had a critical bug in production. TASK: I needed to find root cause quickly. ACTION: I analyzed logs, reproduced locally, traced code. RESULT: Fixed within 2 hours, preventing customer impact." - Specific!

## ENERGY STATEMENT:

"Day 12! I'm 40% done with my transformation! I have the grammar, the fluency, the pronunciation. Now I'm adding STORYTELLING POWER! Every interview story I craft today is a weapon for my interviews. 'Tell me about a challenging bug' - I have a story. 'Tell me about teamwork' - I have a story. 'Tell me about a time you failed' - I have a story. I'm READY. I'm ARMED. 25 LPA HERE I COME!"
