## WEEK 2 SKILLS INTEGRATION

You don't use these skills separately - you COMBINE them:

**Example Answer to "Tell me about yourself":**

"I'm a QA automation engineer with 6 years of experience. *[Thinking in English]*

In my previous role at HCL, I built automation frameworks using Playwright. *[Professional phrases + Pronunciation]*

Let me share a quick example. The situation was: our regression tests took 2 weeks. My task was to reduce this time. I implemented parallel execution and optimized wait strategies. As a result, we reduced testing time by 90% - from 2 weeks to 2 days. *[STAR Method + Connectors]*

Moreover, I've mentored 5 junior testers. I believe that knowledge sharing is essential for team growth. *[Connectors + Opinion phrases]*

I'm confident that my experience aligns well with this senior QA role, and I'd appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your team. *[Workplace communication]*"
