## WEEK 2 GRADUATION SPEECH

**Record yourself saying this (2 minutes):**

"I completed Week 2 of my 30-day English transformation.

In Week 1, I mastered grammar. In Week 2, I mastered fluency.

I learned to use professional connectors - However, Therefore, Moreover - instead of weak words.

I learned to express opinions professionally using 'In my opinion' and 'From my experience' instead of casual phrases.

I learned to think directly in English without translating, which made me faster and more natural.

I perfected my pronunciation - TH sounds, V vs W, word stress patterns.

I mastered the STAR method for behavioral interviews - every story now has clear structure and quantified results.

I learned to communicate professionally in workplace scenarios - polite disagreement, constructive feedback, meeting participation.

I've practiced over 35 hours. I've spoken thousands of sentences. I've made mistakes and corrected them.

I'm not the same person who started Week 2.

I'm faster. I'm clearer. I'm more confident. I sound professional.

Week 3 starts tomorrow - real interview scenarios, technical explanations, behavioral questions.

I'm ready. Bring it on. 25 LPA, here I come!"

**Record this, listen back, be proud of how you sound!**
